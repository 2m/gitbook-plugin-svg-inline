# Motivation

The motivation behind this module is to facilitate producing documentation making optimal use of
visual elements. Although including images within markdown files is a no-brainer, images usually
remain static with at best the possibility to define a single link on the whole picture.
 
What we want is:
* The possibility to define links on any individual elements of the graphical representation.
* The possibility to highlight specific element from this graphical representation.
* The possibility to specify the size the graphical representation.  

## Graphical Representation 

> [A picture is worth a thousand words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_picture_is_worth_a_thousand_words).
 
Image conveys its meaning or essence more effectively than a description does.

## Visual Thinking


Beyond this notion regarding graphical representation lies [Visual Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_thinking).  
   
The concept is greatly elaborated by the books of [Dan Roam](http://www.danroam.com):
* [The Back Of The Napkin](http://www.danroam.com/the-back-of-the-napkin/)
* [Blah Blah Blah](http://www.danroam.com/blah-blah-blah/)
* and [Show & Tell](http://www.danroam.com/show-tell/)
 
## Minto Pyramid Principle

Even beyond Visual Thinking lies the [Minto Pyramid Principle (R)](http://www.barbaraminto.com/index.html),
which says that your thinking will be easy for a reader to grasp if you present the ideas organized
as a pyramid under a single point.

I personally like to think of it as and iceberg, with the emerging point being the reference to which
everything under the water is linked to. You always come back to the top before you dive again into
the details under water, therefore creating a visual map of the complexity. That the helicopter view.
